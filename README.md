AutoQuesty
==========

A World of Warcraft addon to automatically accept and hand in quests.

How do I AutoQuesty?
====================

Simply hold alt when talking to a quest NPC to automatically accept or hand
in every quest that the dude has to offer.

Can AutoQuesty Choose Quest Rewards?
====================================

You bet your questing ass it can! Turn on the feature in the addon settings
(through the default addon settings interface). The highest value reward will
always be chosen, for extra vendor-y cash!

Note that this feature is disabled by default.
