Couple of things this should do based off the readme

First accept all quests with alt pressed

Second hand in all quests with alt pressed

Great that it will pick the highest value item but what if there are multiple quests with an item reward?

Is there a way we can set it to auto pick the one suitable for that class instead using the addon option interface?
